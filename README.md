# Student Dropout Analysis 🎓

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the factors leading to student dropout. Using Python's data science libraries, I analyzed academic performance and socio-economic indicators to find patterns in student attrition.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this study is to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and visualize the relationships between features like **CGPA**, **Family Income**, and **Stress Index** in relation to the dropout status.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Key Features & Analysis
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values in `Family_Income` and `Stress_Index` using median imputation to maintain data integrity.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Implemented a **Heatmap** to identify which numerical features have the strongest impact on student dropout.
* **Academic Impact:** Visualized the correlation between **CGPA** and **Dropout** status using **Boxplots**, highlighting the performance gap.
* **Statistical Styling:** Created a color-coded statistical summary table using Pandas styling for better data readability.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) to see the visualizations.
